=============
Your Move is distributed under the GNU GPLv2. There are no restrictions
on its use. There are restrictions on its distribution in source or
binary form.

Most parts of Your Move are covered by a "GPL version 2 or later" license.
Some files are covered by different licenses that are compatible with
the GPLv2.

As a notable exception, some utilities distributed with the Your Move source are
covered by other licenses that are not themselves directly compatible with the
GPLv2. This is OK, as only the tools themselves are licensed this way, the
output of the tools is not considered a derived work, and so can be safely
licensed for Your Move's use.

Parts of Your Move can be built and distributed as libraries. These
parts are still covered by the GPL, and NOT by the Lesser General Public
License or any other license.

If you integrate all or part of Your Move into your own application, then
that application must be released under a license compatible with the GPL.
